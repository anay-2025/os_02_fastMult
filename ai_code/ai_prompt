Write a C program to compare sequential and parallel matrix multiplication.

Use fork() to create 8 child processes and divide the work row-wise. 
Use mmap() to create a shared memory result matrix for parallel execution. 
Allocate matrices using malloc() and store them as 1D arrays. 
Transpose matrix B before multiplication to improve cache performance. 
Measure execution time of both sequential and parallel versions using clock(). 
Take matrix size as user input and print both execution times.
